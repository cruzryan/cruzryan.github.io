        <h1>Why isn't it easier?</h1>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <h3>We are in the year 2020, it's crazy that after two <span className="note">thousand years</span> these things still take a lot of practice and skill to do.</h3>

        <h2>Exporting a song from your head, to your phone.</h2>
        <br/>
        <h3>Have you ever had a good song idea or remix in your head? Well, it turns out making that song a reality is complicated, even if you don't learn an instrument
            and decide to use a DAW like FL Studio or Ableton, you still have to learn how to use it, how to master & mix, how to use the plugins required to get that effect just right.

            <br/>
            <br/>
            If you work hard and practice a lot, after a couple months (if not years) you might be able to make a song that sounds close enough to the song in your head. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            It should be easier to take a song from your brain and turn it into a .wav/.mp3 file, a lot easier. There has to be a better method.
        </h3>

        <h2>Finding a soulmate</h2>
        <br/>
        <h3>In the U.S. <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/marriages-and-divorces">Almost 50% of marriages end in divorce.</a></h3>
        <br/>
        <h3>You most likely have certain requirements that a person must have in order for you to even consider dating, from gender preferences and economic status preferences, to certain personality traits you want in that person.</h3>
        <br/>
        <h3>We live in a world of 7+ Billion people, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/internet">and almost half of them</a> have access to the internet.</h3>
        <h3>There has to be an easier way for you to find the perfect person that you like and likes you back, or for the perfect person to find you.</h3>
        <br/>
        <h3>I think Facebook and Google have a fair shot in making this a reality, they should use all of the data they have on everyone to make this task easier, instead of the current (mostly random) methods like tinder or trying to find one irl.</h3>
        <br/> 
        <h3>Imagine if, with one click, an app could search a database of 3.5 Billion humans and find the person you were destined to be with, the person who thinks like you, would laugh at your jokes and make you a better human.</h3>

        <h2>Raising a child</h2>
        <br/>
        <h3>For most people, many important teen and life-long adult behavior patterns are influenced by their childhood experiences. <br/>
        <br/>I believe most parents want to give their kids a "good childhood" and raise their kids in a "good way". But actually reading child-development books, and talking to experts is expensive & time consuming. So they just "wing it" and try the best they can.
        <br/><br/>Sadly, most first-time parents are not experts, so they can unintentionally cause future emotional and psychological problems to the child. (From ego problems to future relationship problems etc...) </h3>
        <br/>
        <h3>To me, it's crazy that after thousands of years, parents are still "winging it" when it comes to raising a their child.</h3>
        <br/>
