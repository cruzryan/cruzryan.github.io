        <h3>I've always been interested in where people end up, and how they end up the way they do.</h3>
        <br/>
        <h3>How does a young boy that wants to be an astronaut end up miserable and working a 9-5 accounting job?
            How does a young girl that wants to be a nurse end up miserable working at McDonalds?
            <br/>
            <br/>
            How does someone end up miserable? How did they get there?
        </h3>

        <h3>Of course, every person has a different story, and some people are very unlucky, but in this blog I'm speaking of the average person who grew up in a middle or upper class household and still ended up miserable.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            I've noticed some very consistent patterns across Millenials and Gen Z's that had plenty of oportunities and still end up miserable. I'm writing this article so future generations don't make the same mistakes.</h3>
            <br/>
            <h3>1. They don't realize how many oportunities they have: This is a very strong indicator of people who end up miserable, not realizing that even having free time is an oportunity. It's very important to always be on the look for new oportunities, or go out of your way to make new ones.</h3>
            <br/>
            <h3>2. They don't have a good relationship with time: The worst mistake miserable people make in their teenage years is not constantly reminding themselves that they will grow up, and eventually have to make money. I think it's very important to know where you want to go in life, and know that if you don't act now - the probability of getting there is almost zero.</h3>
            <br/>
            <h3>3. "Life happens to them": This is the most consistent way of thinking that I've noticed across miserable people, they believe they are not in control of their life, and believe that it's always someone else's fault. Never their own.</h3>
            <br/>
            <h3>4. They don't pick the right friends or follow the right people: In my experience, the mindset someone has in a given day is determined by the average mindset of the people they've talked the most in that day. If you only talk with people who gossip, bring you down - and talk about things that don't actually matter then your mind will be filled up with ideas that will make you miserable. <br/><br/>You are who you follow, you are who you talk to, be careful.</h3>
